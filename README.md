This repository exists to demonstrate the React Feedback Button component in action along with a couple of other fun components that I built while setting up the demo.

## React Feedback Button

Inspired by teams that need to aggregate feedback on how users interact with their products, the React Feedback Button allows users to opt into providing feedback when they perform a specific task. In this example use case, the users are service providers on an online job board platform that can choose to either accept a job or to skip it. Understanding why the user base may choose to skip over certain jobs is valuable information for the product development team as it would allow them to identify key pain points that prevent the platform from maximizing revenue.

## Timed Cards

Given the same use case of service providers on a service for hire platform site, the Timed Card component also attempts to maximize revenue.

For customers who have posted a job and are seeking work for hire, they are most likely to accept a quote within the first 15 minutes. The Timed Card component seeks to create a visual sense of urgency for the job service providers to accept a job and provide their quotes within this time frame. It does so by showing the remaining time of the optimal acceptance window, as well as displaying a countdown bar that changes from blue to red as time runs out.

I don't currently have a repository for the Timed Cards component, but will work on creating a HOC repo in the future.
